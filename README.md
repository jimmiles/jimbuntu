Experimenting with a static blog page
I am not a coder, but I am a son of a coder, whose first pro coding gig was for IBM, back in the 1960s.
I have successfully created a home server, using Ubuntu Server 16.04, Apache, Mysql, and PHP.
That server is the new home for my WordPress blog. 
In using Linux, teaching myself how to use it, github has come up often. I am not sure I belong here .
